    "In this section, I’m going to learn the building blocks of trading by covering the basics of financial accounting and investment finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I’ll focus on how to read and understand the three key financial statements: the *balance sheet*, *income statement*, and *statement of cash flows*. I’ll also learn the difference between *accrual accounting* and *cash-basis accounting*. Using these statements, I’ll define, calculate, and interpret common financial ratios, including *liquidity, solvency, activity, profitability, and market price ratios*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I’ll move into investment finance topics, especially the *risk–return relationship and diversification*. I’ll learn what kinds of risk are actually priced and review major asset pricing models like the *Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)*, *Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)*, and an *empirical asset pricing model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I’ll study market mechanics: the types of orders I can place, how the order book works, how orders execute, and how to measure transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I’ll learn what *hedge funds* are and explore *common trading strategies*. By the end, I should be able to confidently interpret a company’s financial statements, understand how risk and return connect to asset pricing, and explain how markets function—including how I can measure my trading costs as an investor.\n",
