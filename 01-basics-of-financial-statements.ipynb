    "In this section, I’m going to learn the building blocks of trading by covering the basics of financial accounting and investment finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I’ll focus on how to read and understand the three key financial statements: the *balance sheet*, *income statement*, and *statement of cash flows*. I’ll also learn the difference between *accrual accounting* and *cash-basis accounting*. Using these statements, I’ll define, calculate, and interpret common financial ratios, including *liquidity, solvency, activity, profitability, and market price ratios*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I’ll move into investment finance topics, especially the *risk–return relationship and diversification*. I’ll learn what kinds of risk are actually priced and review major asset pricing models like the *Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)*, *Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)*, and an *empirical asset pricing model*.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I’ll study market mechanics: the types of orders I can place, how the order book works, how orders execute, and how to measure transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I’ll learn what *hedge funds* are and explore *common trading strategies*. By the end, I should be able to confidently interpret a company’s financial statements, understand how risk and return connect to asset pricing, and explain how markets function—including how I can measure my trading costs as an investor.\n",

    "## Introduction to Accounting\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "Accounting is the formal collection, aggregation, analysis, and reporting of a company’s financial and non-financial information to different end users, with some reporting required regularly (often quarterly). There are three types of accounting:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial accounting:** provides information to people outside the company. Its primary purpose is to help outsiders assess the company’s performance and financial health for decisions like *valuation* (investors, investment banks) and *credit risk* (banks, suppliers). A secondary purpose is to help monitor and evaluate managers and ensure responsible use of resources. Financial accounting is communicated through audited financial statements and disclosures in quarterly and annual reports.\n",
    "- **Managerial accounting:** provides information to people inside the company for internal decision-making—like product costing, profitability and pricing, product mix decisions, adding or discontinuing products, capacity planning, and production volume decisions. It also supports performance evaluation and cost control. These reports aren’t standardized and aren’t audited.\n",
    "- **Tax accounting:** focuses on estimating taxes owed and complying with tax reporting requirements. It’s legal for tax reporting to differ from financial reporting because the rules can be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I’m focusing on financial accounting, and a key concept is **accrual accounting**. Instead of recording transactions when cash moves, accrual accounting records them when the underlying economic event happens. This approach helps measure earnings and the company’s financial position during a period, and it drives the creation of major statements like the **income statement** (profit and loss) and the **balance sheet**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accrual accounting works mainly through:\n",
    "- **Revenue recognition:** record revenue when it’s earned (through delivering a product or service), when it can be measured, and when its collection is reasonably assured.\n",
    "- **Matching:** record expenses in the same period as the revenues they help generate, and for other costs, recognize them over the period when benefits are received.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage is that accrual accounting produces timelier and more decision-relevant financial statements. The main downside is that it relies on judgments and estimates, making it less objectively reliable than cash flows; hence the idea that cash flow is a fact, while earnings involve opinion. Because of this discretion, financial statements follow formal rules and are audited by external auditors.\n",

    "## The Balance Sheet\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance sheet presents a company’s financial position at a specific point in time, typically at the end of a quarter or year. It is made up of three sections: assets, liabilities, and shareholders’ equity, which together show what the company owns, what it owes, and how much money shareholders have invested in the business.\n",
    "- **Assets** are resources the company owns that are expected to generate future economic benefits (either higher cash inflows or lower cash outflows). Examples include cash and equivalents, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets such as patents and trademarks. Assets are classified as **current** (expected to be converted to cash, sold, or consumed within one year) or **non-current** (expected to be realized after one year).\n",
    "- **Liabilities** are the company’s economic obligations to outsiders who have claims on the company’s assets. Examples include accounts payable, short-term borrowing, and long-term debt. Liabilities are also divided into **current** (due within one year) and **non-current** (due after one year).\n",
    "- **Shareholders’ equity** represents the owners’ claim on the company’s total assets. It includes owners’ invested capital and accumulated undistributed profits, known as **retained earnings**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The balance sheet is called a \"balance\" sheet because it must always satisfy the fundamental accounting equation: `Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity`. Assets reflect how the company uses resources, while liabilities and equity reflect where those resources come from, and the two sides must always match. One thing to note is that balance sheet items are recorded at historical cost, meaning they generally are not updated to current market values.\n",
